-   70.8% of Earth covered by ocean
    
-   97.5% of surface water
    
-   Interconnnected global ocean

### Principal Oceans

-   Pacific Ocean - Largest.deepest
    
-   Atlantic Ocean - Second largest
    
-   Indian Ocean - Mainly in Southern Hemisphere
    
-   Arctic Ocean - Smallest,shallowes,Northern Hemisphere $$海大 \ne 水多$$
    

## The water molecule

### polar molecule

lead to these properties:

-   Good dissolving ability
    
-   Hydrogen Bonds
    
-   Cohesion
    
-   Adhesion
    
-   High heat Capacity
    

## Physical properties of water and seawater

### High heat capacity

-   temerature mediation
    
-   heat redistribution
    
-   weather/climate

### Latent Heat

![Pasted image 20250927145148](https://picgo-1385161956.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250927145148.png)

-   Latent Heat of Fusion: Amount of heat needed to change from a solid to a liquid
    
-   Latent Heat of Vaporization：Amount of heat needed to change from a liquid to a vapor
    
    ![Pasted image 20250927145539](https://picgo-1385161956.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250927145539.png)
    
    •Latent heat of vaporization (evaporation) is far greater than latent heat of fusion (melting). •All of the H bonds between $H_{2}O$molecules must be broken to form vapor ==Water also helps moderate global temperatures by redistributing equatorial heat poleward==
    

### Viscosity

-   Definition:The resistance of fluid to flow
    
-   Water:low viscosity
    
-   T increases, viscosity lowers -- Surface water at equator is warmer and less viscous than Arctic
    

### Surface Tension

-   Definition:Lateral and downward attraction between individual molecules
    
-   Creates a strong boundary at surface
    
-   ↑ salt = ↑ surface tension,↓ H2O temp = ↑ surface tension
    

### Compressibility

-   Definition:Substance’s ability to undergo volume changes
    
-   Water:very slight compressibility -- almost incompressible
    

### Density

$$\rho = \rho(T,S,p)$$

-   T(Temperature) water becomes less dense when it freezes

-   S(Salinity) Adding salts increases density decrease freezing point,increase boiling point

-   p(Pressure) changes in pressure are mostly ignored by physical properties of water - seawater is nearly incompressible,but **Dynamically important**.--In situ density & potential density
    

## Chemical properties of seawater

### Salinity

-   Definition:the total quantity of dissolved inorganic solids in water.
    
-   measured in g/kg (ppt = parts per thousand)
    
-   35‰ on average for seawater
    
-   ==Ocean salinities vary in Space and Time==

> Affect salinity:

-   evaporation
    
-   precipitation
    
-   runoff
    
-   freezing
    
-   melting
    

> Components

-   3.5% (by weight) dissolved mineral substances: –Cl- (55%) –Na+ (30.6%) –SO42-(7.7%) –Mg+ (3.7%) –Ca2+ (1.2%) –K +(1.1%) –HCO3-(<1%) –Minor constituents (0.7%) Sr, Br, & C •Minor/trace elements important to living things

### The ocean is in chemical equilibrium(化学平衡)

\==Salinity is not increasing==(rate of addition ~ rate of removal)

#### Where do the ocean's salt come from

-   Positive ions: weathering and erosion
    
-   Negative ions: gases from volcanic eruptions
    
-   Hydrothermal activity supply and remove salt from the deep ocean
    

#### Why is the ocean's salt constant

-   **Input**:rivers,volcanic activity,ground water,hydrothermal vents and cold spirings,and the decay of once-living organisms
    
-   **Output**:sea spray,uptake by living organisms,incorporation into sediments,and ultimately by subduction
    

#### **Principle of constant proportions**

> The percentage of various salts in seawater is the same in samples from many places, regardless how salty the water is.

Cl- is abundant and always accounts for 55% of dissolved salts, the following formula is used to determine salinity: $$Salinity\\ in\\ ‰ = 1.80655 × Chlorinity\\ in \\ ‰$$ For observation, conductivity （电导率）is measured first, and then calculate the corresponding salinity.

### Gases in the seawater

-   **Photosynthesis**:$CO_{2}\to O_{2}$
    
-   **Respiration**:$O_{2}\to CO_{2}$

    Where do they comes from?
    

### PH,Carbonate Buffer

![Pasted image 20250927160149](https://picgo-1385161956.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250927160149.png)![Pasted image 20250927160156](https://picgo-1385161956.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250927160156.png)

-   Seawater:**Basic**,pH 7.5 - 8.5
    
-   Average pH = 7.8
    
-   pH relatively constant due to buffering action of$CO_{2}$
    
-   **Buffer** = substance that prevents sudden or large changes in the acidity or alkalinity of a solution
    
-   Important for biological processes
    
-   pH inversely proportional to the concentration of $CO_{2}$(pH和二氧化碳浓度反比)
